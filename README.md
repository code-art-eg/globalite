# Globalite

## About

Globalite is a simple and lightweight library for internationalization in TypeScript/JavaScript. 
It is inspired by [Globalize](https://github.com/globalizejs/globalize) but uses the built-in `Intl` object for
formatting and parsing dates, numbers, and currencies, instead of building its own formatting and parsing functions.
It also doesn't require the dependency of `cldr-data` or `cldrjs`.
